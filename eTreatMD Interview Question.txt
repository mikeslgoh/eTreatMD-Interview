Hello Michael,

Assignment 1

For the purpose of this interview, I'd like to have you to write a simple Android App. The goal of it is to get you started on some Android dev, and hopefully be useful when you are given a task during your co-op at eTreatMD. 

===================================================


This app would have two pages:

- Patients list
- Patients profile page

-------------------------------------

Page1: 

When the app launches, you need to set a HTTP GET request to

http://159.203.62.239:3000/patients.json

The response should contain a list of patients with their names and ID in a simple JSON array. Once you fetched this list, populate the patients name on a listview. It's up to you how you want to layout the page element. In case if something is wrong with the server, host "patients.json" on your own and fetch it from the device. The goal is really to see how you design code that involves API callings.

-------------------------------------

Page2:

Page2 is shown when the device user selects a patient from the page1's list. This page should contain the name and the ID of the patients. Also, it should have a button that turns on the camera to capture a profile picture for the patients. The picture taken should be displayed on this page as well. 


-------------------------------------

Design and structure the app the best as you can. Nicely structured code are always easier to maintain. Also, you might be collaborating with someone one day. Feel free to use any framework or library that you are comfortable with. Don't spend too long on making the app look nice, we have a in-house designer to take care of that. 

Please upload the source code to GitHub (you can make a public repo, make sure I have no problem rebuilding the app from the source code) and send me the link to it by end of day Thursday, 23 November 2017. Send me a copy of the apk file too just in case. Also, your work here will involve some API design and database design(SQL), so make sure you prepare for it.

Note: It is completely fine if you can't manage to finish the exercise by the deadline. However, make sure you design and structure the project well according to industrial standard/convention. This is very important. 

Good Luck
